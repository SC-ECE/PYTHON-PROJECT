# Face Mesh
MediaPipe Face Mesh is a solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D facial surface, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor. Utilizing lightweight model architectures together with GPU acceleration throughout the pipeline, the solution delivers real-time performance critical for live experiences.
