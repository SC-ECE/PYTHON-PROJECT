# Stone-Paper-Scissors

Stone paper scissors game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "stone", "paper", and "scissors". It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss.

# Rules
A player who decides to play stone will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("stone crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers stone"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
