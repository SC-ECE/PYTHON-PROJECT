# GUI Based Quiz Application using Tkinter and Open Trivia DB

## Description

```
This is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Quiz Application using the Tkinter Python built-in module.

The task is to ask multiple-choice questions, collect user answers and finally display the results. 

Before coding the GUI, I have first fetch multiple-choice questions, their correct answers, and the choices from the Open Trivia DB API. 

The Open Trivia Database provides a completely free JSON API for use in programming projects. Use of this API does not require an API Key. 

To make the task more interesting, I have also randomize the order of choices.

Thus each time the application is run a new set of questions appear.
